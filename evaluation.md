# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Good job with the planning documentation and README. Like that you got into a little bit of Markdown formatting in there too! As your projects get more complex, I would encourage you to include sections like "Installation Instructions" and "Technologies Used" to your README. They will go a long way in getting users familiar with your application.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. You checked off all the technical requirements and then some! Good job incorporating multiple many-to-many relationship in your project. A good next step would be to think about how we can take all those Opinion attributes and make that table more readable. Included a suggestion in my code comments. Maybe consolidating information into separate models could help too.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Your code styling was consistent and very readable - keep it up! And props on separating your stylesheet using comments. Make sure to check out my inline code comments via the link below.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Great job with this assignment. Looks like you know your way around Rails. If you revisit this assignment make sure to take a look through my comments for suggestions on where to go next. Let me know if you have any lingering questions about the project - happy to answer them!
