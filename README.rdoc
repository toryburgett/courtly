= Question: What goes on in the Supreme Court?

To many, the highest court in the land can seem mysterious (other possible adjectives: unknowable and perplexing?). 'Courtly' (temp name until I can think of something cooler) seeks to help offer insight into the court by using comparing the delivery opinions of the the nine justices. How often do the Justices cosign each other's opinion? How often do justices write the majority opinion?
